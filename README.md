# Experius cleanup
This module enables you to cleanup images and data in Magento 2.

### Special thanks to
The commands in this module are copied from [magento-hackathon/EAVCleaner](https://github.com/magento-hackathon/EAVCleaner/tree/magento2) so special thanks to them.
We copied the original repo because it wasn't a fit with our composer but it still contained awesome features, so we decided to create our own version.
